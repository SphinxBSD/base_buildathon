ABOUT

Tims is an application with an integrated wallet that allows you to create Web3-based groups or teams where members can deposit funds into shared “Tims” with different purposes. These Tims or (vaults) can be used for a variety of goals — pooling money for a rotating savings group, a gathering, a social cause, a vacation, or simply saving together with family.

Tims leverages Web3 technology to offer additional features for users, enabling them to **invest, lock funds, or withdraw** funds from the vault, depending on the rules set at the time of creation. Each Tim can be managed by one or more people and uses crypto infrastructure to ensure **transparency and verifiability** for all participants.

Tims is the place where you can collaborate with **friends, colleagues, or acquaintances** to pursue shared goals related to **fund distribution, collective investment, or pooled fund management**. The platform is designed to offer **transparency, efficiency, freedom, and security**, even when your funds are being managed by someone else on behalf of the group.


### **Some example use cases:**

1. Pool money for a party.
2. Invest money with three family members to plan a trip within a year.
3. Organize a rotating savings group (known as a *tanda*).
4. Save together as a couple for a goal, like buying a car.
5. Collect funds for a group bet — for example, an NFL Fantasy League.
6. Raise money for a charitable cause.
7. Use Tims as a payment method for freelancers.

---

Tims allows for transparent fund management even while those funds are being invested. You can label and describe each deposit and withdrawal, offering clarity to everyone involved. Vaults can be managed by **one, two, or three administrators**, and support customizable rules like **multi-signature approvals, timelocks**, and other features that add **flexibility and trust**.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
